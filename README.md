This is a project focused on Web3, and it's part of studies of DApps.

Here we are simulating a crowdfunding platform, where a user can create a project with a target value, deadline, title, description and image.
In the other hand, any user can look to the project details and make a donation to the project

We are using Smart Contract to do the intermediate process, because the donations will stay in the contract wallet until we achieve the deadline and target value.
Otherwise, all donations will be refunded to the donators.

The stack is: 
- thirdweb SDK, Metamask, React and Typescript to interact with our Smart Contract.
- Solidity, Hardhat, and thirdweb deploy to develop, test, and deploy our smart contract.

### [It's live!](https://web3-crowdfunding-chi.vercel.app/)

### How to use?
- Install Metamask and create an account using Sepolia testnet network.
- Create a crowdfunding project.
- Create other account on Metamask, and donate for the project you just created.

You can use this [Faucet](https://www.infura.io/faucet/sepolia) to get a test ether.
